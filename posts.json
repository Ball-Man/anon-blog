            "body": "Today, I learned more about Professor Cellar research. It's chilling how he's using fish to “enhance cognitive abilities.” What a facade! To him, these creatures are mere tools for his ambition. The world may celebrate scientific progress, but at what cost? I won't stand idly by while he exploits the innocent for his misguided experiments.\n\nThe irony is rich: a man who claims to be advancing knowledge, yet he drowns himself in a sea of ethics. I've seen the depths of his cruelty, and I'm determined to shine a light on his darkpractices.",

I’ve heard about some of the fishes he claims to be “enhancing.” They don’t have a voice, but their suffering is loud and clear.\n\nThere’s a fragile balance in our ecosystem, and he’s tipping the scales. If he thinks he can carry on without consequence, he’s gravely mistaken. There are whispers of action in the air, and I’m not the only one who feels this way.",
