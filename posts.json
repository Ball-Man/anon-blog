To him, these creatures are mere tools for his ambition. The world may celebrate scientific progress, but at what cost? I won't stand idly by while he exploits the innocent for his misguided experiments.\n\nThe irony is rich: a man who claims to be advancing knowledge, yet he drowns himself in a sea of ethics. I've seen the depths of his cruelty, and I'm determined to shine a light on his darkpractices.",
